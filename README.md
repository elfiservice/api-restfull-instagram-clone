# Restful API
I developed this API during the complete course of nodejs development.

Using NodeJs and their modules we have developed a Restful API to be consumed by an Instagram-like photo post client application.

Using NodeJs to develop the API, we installed the body-parser module to receive data from a form from the client in the request to the server.

Also installed the connect-multiparty module to handle the trashed files from the client to the server. and using a node's native module, FS to manipulate the file data on the server.

Permissions and Header Access Controls have also been implemented.

For the database was used the non relational mongodb in which integrates perfectly with the nodejs.

On the client side the javascript was used with the Jquery library. Using the XMLHttpRequest object to open a request through the PUT, GET, DELETE, and POST verbs and using their methods to make the necessary treatments and display the response from the server on the client

## Getting Started
To test the API using the instagram clone application, just download the two folders to your pc and have the nodejs installed.
install dependencies on both client and server using npm install on your terminal
```
npm install
```
